The goal is to replace at least automake and libtool with GNU make
macros.  Ideally we'll also replace most of configure -- configure
itself has to remain, to pick install directories and the like, but
most of its checks should be done in the Makefile.

The build works like automake.  The package has a Makefile that
includes Quagmire's "post.mk" at the end.  Special variables in the
Makefile are recognized by Quagmire and turned into rules.
