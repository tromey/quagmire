The goal is to replace at least automake and libtool with GNU make
macros.  Ideally we'll also replace most of configure -- configure
itself has to remain, to pick install directories and the like, but
most of its checks should be done in the Makefile.

The build works like automake.  The package has a Makefile that
includes Quagmire's "post.mk" at the end.  Special variables in the
Makefile are recognized by Quagmire and turned into rules.


One general rule in Quagmire is that if there is a simple, generic GNU
make way to do something, then we don't need special support for it.
This leads to many differences from the way that Automake does things.
For instance, in Automake there is a separate quux_CFLAGS variable for
an aggregate.  In Quagmire, you would instead use a target-specific
CFLAGS assignment.
