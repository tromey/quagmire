To do:

x distclean needs work
  should remove Makefile, config.status, etc

x need support for configure-generated files
  should be automated like variables.in

x program

x shared lib
    this needs porting, testing, and install fixes

x static lib

x pkgconfig
    should be easy to specify packages per aggregate
    something like:

    PROGRAMS = zenity
    zenity_PACKAGES = gtk+-2.0 >= 2.9 libglade-2.0 libgnomecanvas-2.0 glib-2.0

    One general question here is whether to use magic variables, or to
    expose .quagmire/ config targets as part of the API.  The latter
    may be nice for optional packages?

  configure stuff
    this is difficult because there are a lot of inter-dependencies
    for instance consider a common sequence of searching for a
    function in multiple libraries

    See the existing config.h support, which is currently pretty weak.
    For instance we can't search for a function in a library -- only
    in libc

    Think about what to do for things like depcomp

  yacc/lex/c/c++/objc/asm/f77/f90

    Ideally we would have better support for adding on a new language
    than automake currently does.  For instance we could define
    some variables per language or per-lang-and-per-platform (for
    shared libraries)

x dependency tracking

    Ties into the language thing

  cross compilation

    An aggregate could have a flag indicating if it is for the host,
    target, or build machine... much nicer than auto*.

    Need to figure out where to put object files in these cases.
    Maybe always put them in subdirs or the like.

  install scripts/data/headers

    We want to group things by install dir and permissions.
    We could have a variable whose value is a list of variable names,
    but that seems ugly.  What else?

x clean
x tags

  make dist
  make distcheck
  make check
  info (& related targets: dvi, pdf, html, install-*)
  man & install-man (?)

    Use the automake implementations, more or less

  id?  gnu global?  lisp?  java?
  gettext

================================================================

== Automake features we (probably) *don't* want

- ansi2knr

- anything else?


================================================================

== GNU make wish list

gnu make doesn't have a nice way to find a .mk on a path
(without requiring the user to use -I)

see checkfunc.mk -- would be nice to have a built-in 'tr' function
perhaps a builtin regsub too, for depcomp stuff

Better syntax would make it nicer to let users use functions instead of
the current approach.
