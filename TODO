To do:

x program
x shared lib
    this needs porting, testing, and install fixes
x static lib
  pkgconfig
    should be easy to specify packages per aggregate
  configure stuff
    this is difficult because there are a lot of inter-dependencies
    for instance consider a common sequence of searching for a
    function in multiple libraries
  yacc/lex/c/c++/objc/asm/f77/f90
x dependency tracking
  cross compilation
  install scripts/data/headers

x clean
x tags

  make dist
  make distcheck
  make check

  id?  gnu global?  lisp?  java?

================================================================

gnu make doesn't have a nice way to find a .mk on a path
(without requiring the user to use -I)
